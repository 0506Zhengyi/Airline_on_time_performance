This project aims to analyze on-time performance of all commercial flights within the USA in 2008. Analyzing this dataset to discuss the topics we mentioned before can help travelers choose better travel routes in the future. On the other hand, this dataset includes some null/blanks and different kinds of data types, such as numbers and strings, so it is a good practice for us to perform the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
