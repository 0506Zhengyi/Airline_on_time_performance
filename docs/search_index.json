In this project, we will analyze the most recent data in 2008. The data is real and provides complementary information to answer the questions that we are interested in. Analyzing this dataset to discuss the topics we mentioned before can help travelers choose better travel routes in the future. On the other hand, this dataset includes some null/blanks and different kinds of data types, such as numbers and strings, so it is a good practice for us to perform the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

They describe a delay in minutes due to a specific reason. For example, WeatherDelay equals 5 means the delay caused by extreme weather conditions is 5 minutes. These five features have missing values above 1500000 rows. In addition, the other 8 features including ArrTime (actual arrival time), ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, etc. also have some missing values but less than 100000 rows. There are six missing patterns in our dataset and the most common one (more than 1500000 rows) is missing CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, and LateAircraftDelay altogether. This pattern is most common maybe there is no delay in most flights or the reason is unknown. The pattern ranked second is complete cases. The third pattern is missing all of the features in the first pattern plus ArrTime, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, Taxiln, DepTime, DepDelay, and TaxiOut. This may be caused by the cancellation. Thus, we have no information regarding the delay, departure, arrival, etc. The other three patterns share most features with pattern 3 but there are slight differences. Since the number of missing values is much fewer than the first three, we will not discuss them in detail.
