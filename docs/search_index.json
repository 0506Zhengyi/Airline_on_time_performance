In this project, we will analyze the most recent data in 2008. The data is real and provides complementary information to answer the questions that we are interested in. Analyzing this dataset to discuss the topics we mentioned before can help travelers choose better travel routes in the future. On the other hand, this dataset includes some null/blanks and different kinds of data types, such as numbers and strings, so it is a good practice for us to perform the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Convert blank cell to NA There are some blank cells in the original dataset. Changing it to NA will give us better insights regarding missing values. Extract departure hour and arrival hour from DeptTime and ArrTime For two variables Deptime and ArrTime (stored as integer), we extract their first one or two digits by dividing the number by 100 and rounding down to an integer. Then, we had two new variables stand for departure hour and arrival hour respectively. The purpose is to analyze the relationship between hour time and cancellation/ delay in the following chapters. Add origin state and destination state Since we want to consider geographical location and pursue is there any states in America that have more flight cancellations than others, we need the information of departure and arrival state. Unfortunately, this information is not contained in the original dataset. What we have is the original and destination airport. According to the airport code and its corresponding state available online, we added two new variables to include state information into our dataset. The transformed dataset is presented below. ## Year Month DayofMonth DayOfWeek DepTime CRSDepTime ArrTime CRSArrTime ## 1 2008 1 3 4 1343 1325 1451 1435 ## 2 2008 1 3 4 1125 1120 1247 1245 ## 3 2008 1 3 4 2009 2015 2136 2140 ## 4 2008 1 3 4 903 855 1203 1205 ## 5 2008 1 3 4 1423 1400 1726 1710 ## UniqueCarrier FlightNum TailNum ActualElapsedTime CRSElapsedTime AirTime ## 1 WN 588 N240WN 68 70 55 ## 2 WN 1343 N523SW 82 85 71 ## 3 WN 3841 N280WN 87 85 71 ## 4 WN 3 N308SA 120 130 108 ## 5 WN 25 N462WN 123 130 107 ## ArrDelay DepDelay Origin Dest Distance TaxiIn TaxiOut Cancelled ## 1 16 18 HOU LIT 393 4 9 0 ## 2 2 5 HOU MAF 441 3 8 0 ## 3 -4 -6 HOU MAF 441 2 14 0 ## 4 -2 8 HOU MCO 848 5 7 0 ## 5 16 23 HOU MCO 848 6 10 0 ## CancellationCode Diverted CarrierDelay WeatherDelay NASDelay SecurityDelay ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; 0 16 0 0 0 ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; 0 NA NA NA NA ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; 0 NA NA NA NA ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; 0 NA NA NA NA ## 5 &lt;NA&gt; 0 16 0 0 0 ## LateAircraftDelay DepHour ArrHour Origin_state Dest_state ## 1 0 13 13 TX AR ## 2 NA 11 11 TX TX ## 3 NA 20 20 TX TX ## 4 NA 9 9 TX FL ## 5 0 14 14 TX FL "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values (draft) Based on the plot presented above, the columns/features CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, and LateAircraftDelay have the most number of rows in missing value. They describe a delay in minutes due to a specific reason. For example, WeatherDelay equals 5 means the delay caused by extreme weather conditions is 5 minutes. These five features have missing values above 1500000 rows. In addition, the other 8 features including ArrTime (actual arrival time), ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, etc. also have some missing values but less than 100000 rows. There are six missing patterns in our dataset and the most common one (more than 1500000 rows) is missing CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, and LateAircraftDelay altogether. This pattern is most common maybe there is no delay in most flights or the reason is unknown. The pattern ranked second is complete cases. The third pattern is missing all of the features in the first pattern plus ArrTime, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, Taxiln, DepTime, DepDelay, and TaxiOut. This may be caused by the cancellation. Thus, we have no information regarding the delay, departure, arrival, etc. The other three patterns share most features with pattern 3 but there are slight differences. Since the number of missing values is much fewer than the first three, we will not discuss them in detail.
