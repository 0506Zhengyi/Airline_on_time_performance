What could I be delayed by? Which airline has the most delays? These are the problems that have been bothering travelers every time when they have a business trip, holiday travel, or studying abroad. Nowadays, flight delays and cancellations are tricky problems for travelers. In the U.S., there are lots of choices of airlines, airports, and carriers every day in most of the areas. In order to help people better understand the past performance of airlines and plan for their future trips, our group decided to apply advanced data visualization and analytics techniques to a large amount of real airline on-time data from Data Expo. In this project, we are going to provide the observations and insights from our data visuaization results to discuss the questions we are interested in and provide constructive suggestions. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Data sources: Data Expo 2009 - Airline on-time performance The dataset, Data Expo 2009: Airline on-time data, consists of flight arrival, departure, and cancellation details for all commercial flights within the USA from 1987 to 2008. In this project, we will analyze the data of the first 4 months of 2008. The dataset is real and provides complementary information to answer the questions that we are interested in. Analyzing this dataset to discuss flight delay and cancellation-related topics can help travelers choose better travel routes in the future. On the other hand, the dataset includes some null/blanks and different kinds of data types, such as integers and floats, so it is a good practice for us to perform the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. In our group, both members are responsible for collecting the data from the original source. Zhengyi Fang is also responsible for extracting the data that we want to analyze from the entire dataset. There are 2,389,217 records and 29 variables in our final dataset. The dataset variable descriptions and types of variables are listed below: https://github.com/zs2488/Airline_on_time_performance/blob/main/II.Dataset%20Variables.png "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We did the following transformations to make this dataset to be ready for data analysis and visualization. Convert blank cell to NA There are some blank cells in the original dataset. Changing it to NA will give us better insights regarding missing values. Extract departure hour and arrival hour from DeptTime and ArrTime For two variables Deptime and ArrTime (stored as integer), we extract their first one or two digits by dividing the number by 100 and rounding down to an integer. Then, we had two new variables stand for departure hour and arrival hour respectively. The purpose is to analyze the relationship between hour time and cancellation/ delay in the following chapters. Add origin state and destination state Since we want to consider geographical location and pursue is there any states in America that have more flight cancellations than others, we need the information of departure and arrival state. Unfortunately, this information is not contained in the original dataset. What we have is the original and destination airport. According to the airport code and its corresponding state available online, we added two new variables to include state information into our dataset. The transformed dataset is presented below. ## Year Month DayofMonth DayOfWeek DepTime CRSDepTime ArrTime CRSArrTime ## 1 2008 1 3 4 1343 1325 1451 1435 ## 2 2008 1 3 4 1125 1120 1247 1245 ## 3 2008 1 3 4 2009 2015 2136 2140 ## 4 2008 1 3 4 903 855 1203 1205 ## 5 2008 1 3 4 1423 1400 1726 1710 ## UniqueCarrier FlightNum TailNum ActualElapsedTime CRSElapsedTime AirTime ## 1 WN 588 N240WN 68 70 55 ## 2 WN 1343 N523SW 82 85 71 ## 3 WN 3841 N280WN 87 85 71 ## 4 WN 3 N308SA 120 130 108 ## 5 WN 25 N462WN 123 130 107 ## ArrDelay DepDelay Origin Dest Distance TaxiIn TaxiOut Cancelled ## 1 16 18 HOU LIT 393 4 9 0 ## 2 2 5 HOU MAF 441 3 8 0 ## 3 -4 -6 HOU MAF 441 2 14 0 ## 4 -2 8 HOU MCO 848 5 7 0 ## 5 16 23 HOU MCO 848 6 10 0 ## CancellationCode Diverted CarrierDelay WeatherDelay NASDelay SecurityDelay ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; 0 16 0 0 0 ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; 0 NA NA NA NA ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; 0 NA NA NA NA ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; 0 NA NA NA NA ## 5 &lt;NA&gt; 0 16 0 0 0 ## LateAircraftDelay DepHour ArrHour Origin_state Dest_state ## 1 0 13 14 TX AR ## 2 NA 11 12 TX TX ## 3 NA 20 21 TX TX ## 4 NA 9 12 TX FL ## 5 0 14 17 TX FL "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values According to the first plot presented above, the columns/features CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, and LateAircraftDelay have the most number of rows of missing values. These five reasons have missing values above 1,500,000 rows. On the other hand, the other 8 variables, including ArrTime, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, etc. some rows of missing values but the total rows of missing values are all less than 100,000. There are six missing patterns in our dataset and the most common pattern shows that CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, and LateAircraftDelay are missing altogether. Our assumption based on this observation is that most of the flights were not delayed or the reasons of those delays are unknown. The second most-common pattern is that all of the data are shown in the dataset, implying no missing data. The third-most-common pattern is that all of the features in the most-common pattern are missing, plus ArrTime, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, Taxiln, DepTime, DepDelay, and TaxiOut. Our assumption based on this observation is that those flights were canceled, so we have no related information about the delay, departure, arrival, etc. The other three patterns show that the number of missing values is much fewer than that of the three most-common features. Thus, we will not discuss them in detail here. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Flight Cancellation Analysis 5.2 Flight Delay Analysis 5.3 Exploratory Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Flight Cancellation Analysis A=Carrier Caused, B=Weather, C=National Aviation System, D=Security Flight cancelation is one of the biggest concerns for travelers since it not only affects their original schedule but also increases the costs of the air carriers to accommodate the travelers. If a flight is canceled, the travelers have to take the next available same route flight, which may be the same airline on the next day due to the full occupancy of the same-day upcoming flights. In this way, the travelers’ schedules will be harmfully affected. On the other hand, in order to discharge the responsibilities and keep good customer experiences, the air carriers need to cover the rebooking costs, hotel fees, and other related fees. Therefore, finding the reasons for flight cancellation and looking at its pattern in the U.S. will help the travelers better understand the flight performances. Based on the bar plot on the left above, the number of flights caused by the air carrier is the highest. The air carrier’s cause of the cancellation was due to circumstances within the airline’s control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.). Weather condition is another noticeable factor that causes flight cancellations. Extreme weather, significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, can prevent the operation of a flight such as a tornado, blizzard, or hurricane. Based on the bar plot on the right above, large airports or the airports in the main areas(e.g., Illinois, Texas, California, New York, etc.) of the U.S. are most likely to have the flights canceled. According to both plots above, we may conclude that the air carriers that operate in the airports of those states have significant airline control problems or more extreme weather conditions than other states in the U.S. Since these states have some of the largest airports in the U.S., such as O’Hare International Airport, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, and Los Angeles International Airport, it is reasonable to believe that the total number of flights is very large in those states. Travelers may also consider which air carrier to choose to minimize the probability of flight cancellation when those carriers provide similar services and prices. From the plots above, American Airlines, Envoy Air, and SkyWest Airlines have the most flight cancellations. American Airlines is the airline with the largest passenger capacity, total passenger mileage, and fleet in the world. Therefore, we may conclude that the total number of flights is very large so the total number of flight cancellations can be large too and it is hard to manage a large number of flights. However, extreme weather and National Aviation System (NAS) are big problems for Envoy Air and SkyWest Airlines, where NAS cancellations are attributable to the national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control. 5.2 Flight Delay Analysis Even though flight delay may not be as influential as flight cancellation, it still bothers millions of travelers everyday. Here, we would like to analyze the main reason of the flight delays and the average delay time for those delays in 2008. Based on the bar plot on the left above, delay attributable to the National Aviation System, delay attributable to the late-arriving aircraft, and delay attributable to the carrier caused most of the flight delays. Based on the bar plot on the right above, the average delay time of delay attributable to the weather, delay attributable to the late-arriving aircraft, and delay attributable to the carrier is the highest. Also, as shown in the boxplot and ridgeline plot above, the average delay time distributes most from 10 minutes to 25 minutes. Therefore, we highly recommend the travelers check the weather condition before traveling, choose reliable airlines that have good management systems, and avoid the flights that always have late previous airlines. Travelers may also consider which air carrier to choose to minimize the probability of flight delay when those carriers provide similar services and prices. Based on the first plot above, United Airlines, American Airlines, Eva Air, Envoy Air, Mesa Airlines, and Continental Airlines have the longest average delay time that is above 12.5 minutes. Thus, according to the delay reasons discussed before, we suggest those air carriers improve their airline controls and flight on-time management system. It is noticeable that Hawaiian Airlines and 9 Air have negative average delay time, which implies that their flights are very likely to arrive early than the scheduled time. Thus, these two airlines are good choices for travelers. Based on the second plot above, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, Envoy Air, and United Airlines have the largest total number of delay, in which Southwest Airlines has extremely a large amount of flights delayed. NAS and Late Aircraft Arrival are the biggest problems that caused those delays, so airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control may be the root causes. It can be easily observed that United Airlines and American Airlines have very long average delay time and a large number of delays. Besides the price, time, and availability, travelers usually choose the air carriers that have the best service, minimum delay or cancellation probability, and best reputation. According to the Airline Ranking 2008 published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, United Airlines and American Airlines are the largest U.S. air carriers in terms of revenue, the number of passengers, and miles. Even though the performances of United Airlines and American Airlines are not that good based on our observations, we assume the total number of flights of those two carriers is very large so the total number of flight delays can be large too and it is hard to manage a large number of flights. As we can see from the spatial plot above, Illinois and New Jersey rank highest nationwide for departure delays. The main airport in Illinois is O’Hare International Airport, the busiest airport in the U.S., and Newark Liberty Airport is also ranked in the U.S.’s 29 busiest airports for departures. Based on our previous observations that Air Carriers, NAS, and Late Aircraft Arrival are the biggest problems for flight delays. Therefore, the following insights can be obtained: O’Hare International Airport and Newark Liberty Airport are unquestionably the busiest airspace, so any one delay really sends those airports into a disadvantage for on-time performance Due to the increase in population and airlines, the airports are operating at capacities larger than they were built for The two plots above show the top average departure delay of the origin airport and the average arrival delay of the destination airport. An interesting observation is that some airports, including Hilo International Airport, Lihue Airport, Bert Mooney Airport, Bellingham International Airport, and Tupelo Regional AirportTupelo Regional Airport, have negative average departure delay time and negative average arrival delay time. This implies that those airports have better airline management systems and have airlines always ahead of schedule. If we have choices, what is the best time of the day to start our trip? The heatmap above answers this question. It is obvious that the earlier in the day we fly, the less likely we’ll be stuck with flight delays, and delay times only get worse as the day goes on. The probable reasons are the following： The weather conditions at the night are worse. The storms, hurricanes, and heavy snow are more likely to happen at the night There are too many flight delays during the daytime, and airline traffic and airport operation problems are getting worse at the end of the day. According to the plots above, the delays spread over 24 hours of a day and 7 days of a week, so there is no noticeable relationship between ‘Time of a day’ and ‘Total number of delays’. Also, there is no noticeable relationship between ‘Day of a week’ and ‘Total departure delay time’. Therefore, there is no seasonality to the delays by airlines. 5.3 Exploratory Analysis Last but not least, it is worthy to analyze the correlations between the main variables in our dataset. Are there any important insights we can obtain from those variables to help travelers better plan for their future trips? The scatterplot matrix above answers the question and shows: There is a positive correlation between Departure Delay and Arrival Delay Distance of the flight and the Arrival time We assume that If the coefficient value lies between ± 0.50 and ± 1, then it is said to be a strong correlation. If the value lies between ± 0.30 and ± 0.49, then it is said to be a medium correlation. If the value lies below + . 29, then it is said to be a small correlation. Thus, Arrival Time and Distance has a strong correlation, Departure Delay and Arrival Delay has a strong correlation, Departure Hour and Departure Delay has a low correlation, Departure Hour and Arrival Delay has a low correlation No variable has a normal distribution "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 The Airline Performance by Each Delay Reason In 2008 6.2 Interactive Map", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 The Airline Performance by Each Delay Reason In 2008 Nowadays, flight delays is a tricky problem for travelers.

For example, we found the most common reasons for flight cancellations and delays, the relatively busier airports in 2008, and the possible airline control and airport management problems. Despite these findings, our analysis is limited. The goal of our analysis was to help nowadays travelers have better insights into the situation they faced and the challenges they may meet in the future. Also, we desired to provide constructive suggestions for their plan. However, big data can tell a reliable story but still have some limitations. First, we used part of the U.S. airline on-time performance data of 2008, which shows important observations but additional data may be needed for more insightful analysis. Under the background of the COVID-19 pandemic since 2019, the airline industry was strictly harmed and adjusted to a large extent. In order to provide more up-to-date information to the travelers, we think it is necessary to gain the newest data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and perform the data analysis. In addition to limitations in data, there also existed limitations in analysis. There are lots of factors determining the overall performance of the airlines, not only flight cancellation rates and flight delays. Airline Quality Rating releases report each year to assess airline quality on combined multiple performance criteria. Also, customer experiences and ratings to the airlines are also important. In the future, a more comprehensive analysis can be helpful for travelers, transportation bureaus, airport managers, etc. In 2008, we found the busy scenario of the airports, growing airline industries, and the uncontrollable situations that influence the airline industry. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw rearrangements and massive airline cancellations. Now, the U.S. is on its way to leaving the pandemic behind. For instance, borders reopen, people start to travel again, and the number of flights is constantly growing. Therefore, airlines’ on-time performance is back in focus. We hope to let the world know the importance of airline analysis and we are looking forward to having more precise insights in this big data era.
