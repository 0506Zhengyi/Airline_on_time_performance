# Introduction

(draft)

The dataset consists of flight arrival, departure, and cancellation details for all commercial flights within the USA from 1987 to 2008. In this project, we will analyze the most recent data in 2008. The data is real and provides complementary information to answer the questions that we are interested in. Analyzing this dataset to discuss the topics we mentioned before can help travelers choose better travel routes in the future. On the other hand, this dataset includes some null/blanks and different kinds of data types, such as numbers and strings, so it is a good practice for us to perform the data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
